# How to Use the Contributors Sandbox
The Contributors Sandbox folder is a place to learn and experiment, so free to add and update pages there. The folder is visible only to users in the Contributors group, which is currently everyone with login priveleges (i.e. everyone excepts Guests).

All users in the Contributors group have full viewing and editing priveleges, so please don't update pages created by other Contributors without their permission, and please clean up (i.e. delete) pages that you no longer need. If you want to experiment with a page already created by someone else, I suggest you create a new page using the existing page as a template.

Have fun!
